## My process

For this challenge I started with the HTML code and then styled with CSS from the top down using dummy data (the example from the challenge files).  Once I got the advice generator card to look
the way I wanted I coded in the Javascript to connect with the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned more about the `transform: translateY(50%);` in my css properties to get the dice icon exactly where I wanted it.  Other than that 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
